What type of Data Science Questions?

Descriptive
Exploratory
Inferential
Predictive
Causal
Mechanistic


Descriptive Analysis
-----------------------

Goal is to describe the data , you are not trying to predics anything.
Goal = Describe the set of data

This First Kind of data analysis performed
commonly applied to census data
description and interpretation are 2 different steps
desrciption can usually not be generalized without additional statistical modeling

Describes the data, for example: How widely dispersed is the data? Are there lot of different values? Are many of the values the same? what velue is in the middle of the data? where does a particular data stand with rspect to other values in the data set?

Descriptive Analysis results can be show using graphics - Histogram, bar , pie charts. table 


Inferential Statistics : ways of analyzing the data that allows you to make a conculsion about weather a hypothesis was supported by the results.

Inference : to draw conclusion from clues in the environment

Hypothesis: educated guess

t-test : compare avg scores between 2 groups 

ANOVA : Analysis of varaince : 3 or more groups


Prediction is more challanging than inference

 


Exploratory Analysis
====================

Goal: Find the relationships you did not know about

Exploratory models are good for discovering new connections
They are also useful for defining future studies
Exploratory analyses are usually not the final say
Exploratory analyses alone should not be used for generalizing / predicting

correlation does not imply causation



Inferential
===============

Goal ; take small amount of data ( sample) and extroplate to general (population)  small sample of data have to say something about a bigger population

Inference is commonly the goal of statistical model
Inference involves estimating quantity you care and uncertainity about your estimate

Depends of population and sample 


Predictive
===============

challanging

Use data collected on one Object
Predict another object

If X predicts Y , does not mean X causes Y
Measure the right variables to get accurate Prediction


Causal
===============

If change the value of M , what will happen to N 

Randomized Studies are required to identify causation

Causal relationship are idenfied using Avergae effects
(e.g. if we use this drug, on an average , please respond....)

Causal "gold" standard



Mechanistic
===========

Exact changes in variables that leads to exact changes in other vaiables for individual objects

Incedible hard to infer
modeled by determinstic set of equations 
random component of the data is measurement error








Prediction Key quantities



Pr ( Correct Outcome) = Accuracy
Pr ( Positive Test | disease) = sensitivity

pr (negative Test | no disease) = specificity

pr(disease | positive test) = Positive Predictive Value
pr( no disease | Negative Value) = Negative Predictive Value


good experiment = have replication , measure variability

good experiment = transparent in terms of code and data


prediction is not inference

Data Dredging: Data dredging, sometimes referred to as "data fishing" is a data mining practice in which large volumes of data are analyzed seeking any possible relationships between data. The traditional scientific method, in contrast, begins with a hypothesis and follows with an examination of the data. Sometimes conducted for unethical purposes, data dredging often circumvents traditional data mining techniques and may lead to premature conclusions. Data dredging is sometimes described as "seeking more information from a data set than it actually contains."


Inferential: Do math on the sample and make conclusion ( inferences)




























Experimental Design

Have a Plan for Data and Code Sharing
Example: github.com
Example: figshare.com ( Share your data)


Formulate your question in Advance

example: Does changing the test on your website improve domnation?
Experiment:
1. Randomly show visitos one version or other
2. Measure how much they donate
3. Determine which one is better


Statistical Inference

Poplulation = Complete possible data set (e.g. all in US)
Sample = Subset of Data

Descriptive Statistics = calculate AVG based on Sample data

Inferential Statistics = Take the Desciptive Stat and apply to see if the same will apply to large data set ( Population)

if the variability is high between "Signup" version of site as compared to "Donate" version of site , then it makes sense to adopt one version as compared to another


Cofounding :  Shows -

Variable "Age" might be "Confounder" for variable "Shoe" and "Literacy"
Pay attention to all the variables which are cauring corelation
"Corelation" is not "Causation"

Observed corelation may not be actual relationship, it might be bacause of a "confounder"

In statistics, a confounding variable (also confounding factor, a confound, or confounder) is an extraneous variable in a statistical model that correlates (directly or inversely) with both the dependent variable and the independent variable.

How to do deal with "confounders"?

1. Fix them : example show "obama 2012" on both a / b sites
2. Stratify : use both web site colors with equal phrases
3. If you cannot fix a variable , cannot stratify it , you need to Randomize it. Randomize the confounding variable , so its impact is diluted
