what is CRAN?
Comprehensive R Archive Network

With R you get base system

R is useful because it has large collection of packages to extend the basic functionality of R

R packages are developed and Published by larger R community

Primary location to get R packages is CRAN

For Bioloigal applications, Many packages are available @ BioConductor Project


How do you find available packages on CRAN , use available.packages() function

a <- available.packages()
head ( rownames(a), 3)

will show 3 packges row names

How do you find default packages in R

> getOption ("defaultPackages")

R package is collection of R functions, data and compiled code

library() to see all the packages installed: There are 5200+ packages
you can also check Task view list: Group togeather packages to area of your interest


to install a single package

install.package("slidify")

Any package on which this package depends on will also be downloaded and installed

How to install mutiple packages

install.packages( c("slidify", "ggplot2", "devtools") )

Use the c vector, lower case c

install.packages ( c("pkg1","pkg2","pkgn"))





How do you install a package from BioConductor

source ("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
biocLite()


Installing a package in R does not make it available , you need to load the package.

library(ggplot2)

will load the ggplot2 package 
Dont put the name of the package in quote

Dependcies packages will be loaded as well


After you load the package , how do you know it is there loaded?
