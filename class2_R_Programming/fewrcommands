Coulmn names are
Subject  Eye.Color  Height  Hand.Span  Sex  Handedness


lets only get the columns we are interested in
people1<-subset(people, select=c(Hand.Span, Sex, Eye.Color))

remove 1st, 3rd and 6th column
people1<-people[-c(1,3,6)]

keep 2nd, 4th and 1st column
people1<-people[c(2,4,1)]

for all "people" with Height < 165 
subset(people, Eye.Color=="Brown" & Height<165)

people with Height < 165 but get Hand.Span and Height column only
subset(people, Height<165, select=c(Hand.Span, Height))

people with Eye.color either Brown or Green
subset(people, Eye.Color %in% c("Brown", "Green"))
