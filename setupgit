#This is how I setup git and github
#Directory is jh = local computer , jh.git on github



##Step 1 : Setup local Repo , I will call it jh on my laptop
jh = john hopkins

My goal is to add classes in this one and add notes for each class


Sudhirs-MacBook-Pro:datatrack sudhirwadhwa$ mkdir jh
Sudhirs-MacBook-Pro:datatrack sudhirwadhwa$ cd jh
Sudhirs-MacBook-Pro:jh sudhirwadhwa$ pwd
/Users/sudhirwadhwa/datatrack/jh
Sudhirs-MacBook-Pro:jh sudhirwadhwa$ ls

##Step2 : Init the git Repo ( I am in jh directory, pwd = /Users/sudhirwadhwa/datatrack/jh)


Sudhirs-MacBook-Pro:jh sudhirwadhwa$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/sudhirwadhwa/datatrack/jh/.git/
Sudhirs-MacBook-Pro:jh sudhirwadhwa$ 
Sudhirs-MacBook-Pro:jh sudhirwadhwa$ ls -al
total 0
drwxr-xr-x   3 sudhirwadhwa  staff  102 Jun 12 14:39 .
drwxr-xr-x   7 sudhirwadhwa  staff  238 Jun 12 14:39 ..
drwxr-xr-x  10 sudhirwadhwa  staff  340 Jun 12 14:39 .git

Sudhirs-MacBook-Pro:jh sudhirwadhwa$ git config --list
user.name=sudhirwadhwa
user.email=sudhir.wadhwa@outlook.com
push.default=simple
core.repositoryformatversion=0
core.filemode=true
core.bare=false
core.logallrefupdates=true
core.ignorecase=true
core.precomposeunicode=true

## I created an empty file , touch a in /Users/sudhirwadhwa/datatrack/jh


Sudhirs-MacBook-Pro:jh sudhirwadhwa$ git status
On branch master

Initial commit

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

	a

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

## Let me add my file a to staging area

Sudhirs-MacBook-Pro:jh sudhirwadhwa$ 
Sudhirs-MacBook-Pro:jh sudhirwadhwa$ 
Sudhirs-MacBook-Pro:jh sudhirwadhwa$ git add a
Sudhirs-MacBook-Pro:jh sudhirwadhwa$ git status
On branch master

Initial commit

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)

	new file:   a



## Let me commit to the work so far 

Sudhirs-MacBook-Pro:jh sudhirwadhwa$ git commit -m "adding blank file"
[master (root-commit) 1c4c835] adding blank file
 1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
 create mode 100644 a

## Now commit done on local branch , 
## I also wen ahead and created github account and created a Repo there called jh.git
## My goal is to link my jh ( local repo on my laptop) to github Repo ( remote jh.git)


## in order to sync , let me pull from remote to local first
## Because remote has Readme.MD file 


Sudhirs-MacBook-Pro:jh sudhirwadhwa$ git pull -u jh master
